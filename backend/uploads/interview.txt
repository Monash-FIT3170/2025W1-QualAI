Interview Transcript: Travel Experience to Paris

Interviewer: Hi, and welcome! Today we’re talking with Emma, who recently returned from a trip to Paris. Thanks for joining us, Emma!

Emma: Thanks for having me! I’m excited to share my experience.

Interviewer: Let’s start with the basics—when did you go to Paris and how long did you stay?

Emma: I went in early June and stayed for about 10 days. It was the perfect time—warm weather, lots of sunshine, and not too crowded.

Interviewer: What inspired you to choose Paris as your destination?

Emma: Paris has always been on my bucket list. I’ve always been fascinated by the art, the architecture, and of course, the food. I wanted to experience the culture firsthand.

Interviewer: What were some of the highlights of your trip?

Emma: There were so many! Visiting the Louvre was incredible—I spent hours there. Seeing the Eiffel Tower sparkle at night was magical. I also loved walking through Montmartre and discovering little cafés and art shops.

Interviewer: Did you try any local foods or restaurants that stood out?

Emma: Absolutely. I had the best croissants at a bakery near my hotel. I also tried escargot for the first time—it was surprisingly good! One of my favorite meals was at a small bistro in Le Marais. The duck confit was amazing.

Interviewer: How did you find getting around the city?

Emma: The metro system was really efficient and easy to use once I got the hang of it. I also walked a lot—it’s such a walkable city, and you see so much more that way.

Interviewer: Any challenges or surprises during your trip?

Emma: I think the biggest challenge was the language barrier. I speak a little French, but not fluently. Most people were very helpful, though. Also, I didn’t expect how late dinner starts—many restaurants don’t get busy until after 8 p.m.

Interviewer: What advice would you give someone planning a trip to Paris?

Emma: Plan ahead, but leave room for spontaneity. Some of my favorite moments were unplanned—like stumbling upon a street performance or a hidden garden. Also, learn a few basic French phrases; it goes a long way.

Interviewer: Would you go back?

Emma: In a heartbeat! There’s still so much I didn’t get to see. Next time, I’d love to explore more of the museums and maybe take a day trip to Versailles.

Interviewer: Thanks so much for sharing your experience, Emma. It sounds like an unforgettable trip!

Emma: Thank you! It really was.
